        "Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: Object-oriented programming organizes programs using objects and classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Abstraction hides details while encapsulation protects data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: Dunder methods are Python’s special double-underscore methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Inheritance allows a child class to use a parent class’s features.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Polymorphism allows one name to behave differently in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Encapsulation is done using private/protected variables and access methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  A constructor is the `__init__` method that initializes objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Class methods use `cls`, and static methods act as normal functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER: Method overloading is mimicked using default arguments or `*args`.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Method overriding means redefining a parent method in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  A property decorator gives controlled getter/setter-like access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Polymorphism is important because it increases flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  An abstract class contains abstract methods and cannot be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  OOP provides modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Multiple inheritance means inheriting from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Class variables are shared by all objects; instance variables are object-specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  `__str__` gives a readable string; `__repr__` gives a detailed representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  `super()` is used to call the parent class’s methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  `__del__` is the destructor method called when an object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  `@staticmethod` has no class/object access; `@classmethod` uses `cls`.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Polymorphism works through method overriding in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  Method chaining is calling multiple methods by returning `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER:  `__call__` allows an object to be invoked like a function.\n"
